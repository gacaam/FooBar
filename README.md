# FooBar Program in C#
Welcome to the FooBar Program! This repository contains a simple implementation of a FooBar program written in C#. The program generates a sequence of numbers and replaces specific indexes with "foo", "bar", or "foobar" based on the following rules:

- Indexes divisible by 3: Returns "foo"
- Indexes divisible by 5: Returns "bar"
- Indexes divisible by both 3 and 5: Returns "foobar" (excluding index 0)
